architecture and end user environment workstation development at stanford james h clark workstation development at stanford be closely link with graphic distribute system and networking two distinct system have evolve over the last 3 year the sun system and the iris system the sun be a lowcost system base upon a efficient mc68000 processormemory design and a relatively lowperformance highresolution bitmap display the iris lrb integrated raster imaging system rrb be base upon the same mc68000 design but the graphic part of the system be a modest to lowcost highperformance highresolution color or black and white system that use the geometry engine and several other custom ic part both sun and iris interface to the stanford ethernet network and both be be use for distribute system research vlsi design station and graphic research in addition iris will probably be use for mechanical cad research by the mechanical engineering department and in situation where highperformance graphic be important improvement goal for workstation facilities robert m dunn three major area of improvement be need interaction technique that be simpler provide faster reaction be useful for higherlevel input and have userstyleoriented alternative the second area be for image render base on local capability in vary degree of image quality as a function of desire 8220 grade of service 8221 the third area be to provide support to incremental model construction and approximate design evaluation there must be evaluation technique that can work on partial model and give one approximate result implication of these criterion for workstation architecture will be discuss the application of network workstation to largescale engineering harvey kriloff the development of computerized analysis procedure during the last twenty year have be largely orient toward provide increase analytic function this have mean that consideration of user access to specific capability or ease of use of these mammoth program be only now become user concern the emerge new technology for display input and they interaction when apply to the professional workstation will be play a increasingly important role in satisfy these concern a professional workstation can be use both to improve the efficiency by which data be collect for a existing analysis program and to assist the user in the preparation of datum for a formal presentation or report this performance improvement can be accomplish through the development of useradapted 8220 macro procedure 8221 for datum entry the execution of process to check program input datum for accuracy and consistency and workstation assistance in the training of both new and exist user at the output stage of analysis the workstation can be use to select and reformat information prepare by the analysis program explore the interrelationship of result from several different analysis and derive the datum for a succeed analysis in a iterative design mode at boeing computer services we have be explore the benefit realize by the development of such a workstation when apply to the field of structural engineering a interactionrich workstation with a humanengineered executive that control and integrate the user interface connect to we national network of ibm cdc and cray computer with a broad variety of engineering software

that this workstation lrb distribute rrb methodology for do engineering and other quantitative professional function will radically change the way these analytical process be perform personal workstation in a local network david nelson for many application personal workstation provide a superior form of computing compare to timesharing the requirement of workstation however go well beyond the facility provide by the local computer they must include the equivalent advantage of timeshare such as usertouser communication shared program and datum file share peripheral etc the preferred way to implement these function be to interconnect all workstation by means of a highspeed local network control by a distribute operating system which provide transparent access to all network resource through a networkwide virtual memory system additional workstation function such as large virtual address space and a concurrent multiplewindow display system significantly increase user productivity a high resolution bitmap display system with hardware support for dynamics be a essential component for the future we look towards both significant cost reduction and improvement in performance as
