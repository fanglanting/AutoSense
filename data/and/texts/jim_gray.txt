complex and complete application it be the job of the system to translate a highlevel description of datum and procedure into efficient algorithm the real performance metric of a system be how successfully it meet these goal practitioner use a much narrower definition of system performance they assume a standard workload and measure performance by peak throughput and by dollar cost per transaction although many vendor have 8220 private 8221 performance measure bitton dewitt and turbyfill be the first to publish a measure of database system performance lsb bitton rsb they measure here call the wisconsin benchmark consist of a database design a set of 32 retrieval and update statement and a script for multiuser test they give two performance metric the elapsed time for each statement and the throughput of the system when run sixteen simultaneous script no response time requirement or cost measure be include in the definition the wisconsin benchmark be the most widely use database benchmark largely in response to the wisconsin benchmark a informal group include bitton and dewitt define a benchmark more representative of transaction processing application lsb anon rsb its workload be list item scan a minibatch operation to sequentially copy 1000 record item item sort a batch operation to sort one million record item item debitcredit a short transaction with terminal input and output via x 25 presentation service and a mix of five database access item list the debitcredit transaction have rule for scale the terminal network and database size as the transaction rate increase and also rule for distribute transaction if the system be decentralize the performance metric for this benchmark be list item elapsed time for the scan and sort item item peak throughput for the debitcredit transaction at 1 second response time for 95 of the transaction this give a tps lrb transaction per second rrb rating item item price per transaction where price be the 5year cost of hardware software and maintenance this be sometimes call the vendorsview of price item list this benchmark have be adopt by several vendor to compare they performance and price performance from release to release and also to compare they performance to competitive product mips whetstone and megaflop have serve a similar role in the scientific community a system s tps rating indicate not just processor speed but also io architecture operate system datum communication and database software performance unfortunately it do not capture easeofuse work continue on formalize these benchmark at present they be write in english ultimately they should be define by a file generator and a set of program write in a standard database language such as cobolsql when a vendor first measure he system against these benchmark the result be usually terrible both benchmark be design to expose generic performance bug in frequently use transaction processing atom for example the wisconsin and scan benchmark heavily penalize a system which be slow to read the next record in a file a system with poor performance on these benchmark can be analyze as follow most vendor have a 8220 atomic 8221 model of they system which represent each transaction as a collection of atom the atom be the primitive of the system for example the scan benchmark be represent by most vendor as scan begin transaction perform 1000 times read sequential insert sequential commit transaction the atomic weight for begin read sequential insert sequential and commit be measure for each release the atomic weight usually consist of cpu instruction message byte and disc io for a 8220 typical 8221 call to that operation these weight can be convert to service time by know the speed and utilization of the device lrb processor disc line rrb use for the application the molecular weight and service time of scan can then be compute as the sum of the atomic weight define and measure a system s atom be valuable it produce a simple conceptual model of how the system be use atomic measurement also expose performance bug for example base on the scan benchmark most system perform read sequential in 1000 instruction and with 02 disc io if a system use many more instruction or many more io then it have a performance problem similarly the debitcredit transaction typically consume about 2ooki lrb thousand instruction rrb and five disc io per transaction one system be know to use 800ki and 14 io per transaction the vendor could use atomic measurement to find the cause of such poor performance when such problem be localized to a atom solution to the problem readily suggest themselves so atomic measurement be useful for performance assurance and performance improvement atomic measurement also have a major role in system size and in capacity planning if the customer can describe he application in term of atom then a spreadsheet application can give he a estimate of the cpu disc and line cost for the application with substantially more effort lrb and assumption rrb the system s response time can be predict with even more effort a prototype system can be generate and benchmark
