1654676	kai_zhang weijun_liu	microstructure evolution of stainless steel during laser metal deposition shape	laser metal deposition shape lrb lmds rrb be a process that fuse gas deliver metal powder within a focal zone of a laser beam to produce fully dense 3dimensional metal component a variety of material have be process with lmds range from stainless steel to superalloy to evaluate the processing parameter and result microstructure solidification study have be perform on define alloy system for example solidification cooling rate and growth velocity have be determine base upon secondary dendrite arm spacing form during solidification in stainless steel correspond to the great change of cool rate growth rate vary dramatically as a result process definition have be develop base upon the microstructure evolution during solidification	Proceedings_of_the_2009_International_Conference_on_Measuring_Technology_and_Mechatronics_Automation_-_Volume_02	Sch._of_Mech._Eng.

1658742	kai_zhang hong_bao min_zhou	research on the application of industrial ct for relics image reconstruction	the purpose of this paper be to visualize the internal structure of historic relic by use the industrial computedtomography lrb ct rrb the image reconstruction of ct scan datum can be use to observe and analyze the antique inside that the eye have no way to distinguish without disruption this paper have build the simulated testing model produce the datum of simulate projection and accomplish the comparison of image reconstruction between of art lrb sirt rrb and fdk algorithm after handle the real datum of different material the experiment and analysis of ct image reconstruction have be carry out this job have provide the effective technology support in the research of the heritage compute tomography scan platform this paper also have provide the information for teaching and learning activity of cultural study	Proceedings_of_the_2009_Asia-Pacific_Conference_on_Information_Processing_-_Volume_01	Inst._of_Inf._Technol.
