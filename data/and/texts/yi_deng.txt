1749337	xudong_he yi_deng	a approach for design and analysis of usercentric communication middleware	the evolution towards emerge active distribution networks lrb adn rrb can be realize via a realtime state estimation lrb rtse rrb application facilitate by the use of phasor measurement unit lrb pmus rrb a critical challenge in deploy pmubased rtse application at large scale be the lack of a scalable and flexible communication infrastructure for the timely lrb ie subsecond rrb delivery of the high volume of synchronize and continuous synchrophasor measurement we address this challenge by introduce a communication platform call cdax base on the informationcentric networking lrb icn rrb concept with a topicbased publishsubscribe engine that decouple datum producer and consumer in time and space cdax enable efficient synchrophasor measurement delivery as well as flexible and scalable lrb re rrb configuration of pmu datum communication for seamless full observability of power condition in complex and dynamic scenario base on the derive set of requirement for support pmubased rtse in adn we design the icnbased cdax communication platform together with a joint optimize physical network resource provision strategy in order to enable the agile pmu datum communication in near realtime in this work cdax be validate via a field trial implementation deploy over a sample feeder in a real distribution network it be also evaluate through simulationbased experiment use a large set of real medium voltage grid topology currently operate live in the netherlands this be the first work that apply emerge communication paradigm such as icn to smart grid while maintain the require hard realtime datum delivery as demonstrate through field trial at national scale as such it aim to become a blueprint for the application of icnbased general purpose communication platform to adn doi 101109 tsg 20152398840 adn timestamp icn pmu pmus	null	Florida_International_University
