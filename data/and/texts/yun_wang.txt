1724884	h._t._banks r._c._smith yun_wang	the modeling of piezoceramic patch interaction with shell plate and beam	this paper present a electromechanical impedance lrb emi rrb model for damage identification of thin plate structure firstly a damage thin plate with a pair of piezoceramic lrb pzt rrb transducer bond on the opposite side be consider and the pure bend vibration of the plate actuate by the pzt patch be analyze then a method which combine the pritz method and the matrix perturbation method be propose to obtain the approximate analytic relation between the mechanical impedance of the damage plate and the physical parameter of damage base on the interaction model between the pzt and the plate a analytic relation between the admittance of pzt and the physical parameter of damage can be derive finally numerical example be use to verfy the validity and feasibility of the propose emi model the result indicate that the emi model be more applicable for the thin plate structure with small damage	Quarterly_of_Applied_Mathematics
