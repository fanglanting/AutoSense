17589312	kaiser heidegger wibral altmann lutzenberger	alpha synchronization during auditory spatial shortterm memory	recent study have suggest a active role of cortical alpha oscillation for cognitive function include shortterm memory we use magnetoencephalography to assess alpha activity during a auditory spatial delay matchingtosample task compare with a nonmemory control condition in the memory task participant have to memorize the lateralization angle of a noise stimulus s1 and compare it with another lateralize sound s2 present after a 800ms delay phase whereas alpha desynchronization follow s1 be observe over superior temporal area under both condition only the memory task be accompany by posterior parietal alpha synchronization during the subsequent delay period the finding be consistent with the notion of alpha activity reflect active inhibition of interfere process during memory maintenance of spatial sound	Neuroreport.
18252742	kaiser heidegger wibral altmann lutzenberger	distinct gammaband components reflect the shortterm memory maintenance of different sound lateralization angles	oscillatory activity in human electro or magnetoencephalogram have be relate to cortical stimulus representation and they modulation by cognitive process whereas previous work have focus on gammaband activity lrb gba rrb during attention or maintenance of representation there be little evidence for gba reflect individual stimulus representation the present study aim at identify stimulusspecific gba component during auditory spatial shortterm memory a total of 28 adult be assign to 1 of 2 group who be present with only right or leftlateralized sound respectively in each group 2 sample stimulus be use which differ in they lateralization angle lrb 15 degree or 45 degree rrb with respect to the midsagittal plane statistical probability mapping serve to identify spectral amplitude difference between 15 degree versus 45 degree stimulus distinct gba component be find for each sample stimulus in different sensor over parietooccipital cortex contralateral to the side of stimulation peak during the middle 200300 m of the delay phase the differentiation between preferred and nonpreferred stimulus during the final 100 m of the delay phase correlate with task performance these finding suggest that the observe gba component reflect the activity of distinct network tune to spatial sound feature which contribute to the maintenance of taskrelevant information in shortterm memory	Cereb_Cortex.
18554295	kaiser heidegger lutzenberger	behavioral relevance of gammaband activity for shortterm memorybased auditory decisionmaking	oscillatory activity in the gammaband range have be establish as a correlate of cognitive process include perception attention and memory only a few study however have provide evidence for a association between gammaband activity lrb gba rrb and measure of behavioral performance here we focus on the comparison between sample and test stimulus s1 and s2 during a auditory spatial shortterm memory task apply statistical probability map to magnetoencephalographic recording from 28 human subject we identify gba component distinguish nonidentical from identical s1s2 pair this activity be find at frequency between 65 and 90 hz and be localized over posterior cortical region contralateral to the hemifield in which the stimulus be present the 10 best task performer show higher amplitude of this gba component than the 10 worst performer this group difference be most pronounced between about 150 and 300 m after stimulus onset apparently the decision about whether test stimulus match the store representation of previously present sample sound rely partly on the oscillatory activation of network represent difference between both stimulus this result could be replicate by reanalyze the combined datum from two previous study assess shortterm memory for sound duration and sound lateralization respectively similarly to we main study gba amplitude to nonmatching vs matching s1s2 pair be higher in good performer than poor performer the present finding demonstrate the behavioral relevance of gba	Eur_J_Neurosci.
18602906	kaiser rahm lutzenberger	direct contrasts between experimental conditions may yield more focal oscillatory activations than comparing pre versus poststimulus responses	contrast electro or magnetoencephalographic oscillatory response to sensory stimulus with a prestimulation baseline commonly yield spectrally broad and topographically distribute activation in contrast comparison between closely match task condition usually result in more focal difference in the present study we reanalyze a exist set of meg datum record during stimulation with virtual kanizsa figure and notriangle control stimulus to contrast result yield by the two approach statistical analysis show that visual stimulation compare to baseline give rise to spectral amplitude reduction in lower frequency include alpha and beta and amplitude enhancement in gamma frequency above 55 hz these change reach significance by about 100 m poststimulus onset be topographically widespread over posterior cortex and do not differ between stimulus a second more focal component over ventral occipital cortex peak at about 300 m in the gamma range at approximately 70 hz it be more pronounced for the kanizsa triangle than for the notriangle stimulus a third gamma component over lateral occipitotemporal cortex show a amplitude increase at around 450 m for virtual figure and a concomitant decrease for the nongestaltlike control stimulus and no overall taskrelated activity we finding illustrate that direct comparison between condition yield effect with a more focal spectral and topographical distribution than comparison with a prestimulus baseline moreover they exemplify that contrast between condition may reveal additional activation not capture by comparison with a prestimulus baseline	Brain_Res.
18790066	kaiser rahm lutzenberger	temporal dynamics of stimulusspecific gammaband activity components during auditory shortterm memory	recently we have demonstrate that during auditory shortterm memory maintenance gammaband activity lrb gba rrb component can be identify which be specific to the retain stimulus these activation peak in the middle of the delay phase between sample and test stimulus and they magnitude during the final part of this period correlate with performance however use a constant delay duration do not allow to answer the question whether stimulusspecific gba component represent response to sample sound or anticipatory activation precede test stimulus here we address this unresolved issue by investigate the temporal dynamics of stimulusspecific gba during two delay duration magnetoencephalogram be record in 18 adult during a auditory spatial shortterm memory task involve lateralized sample stimulus present with two different interaural time delay subject have to decide whether test stimulus present after retention phase of 800 or 1200 m have the same lateralization as sample sound statistical probability mapping serve to identify oscillatory activation differentiate between the two sample sound we find stimulusspecific gba component over posterior cortex peak about 400 m prior to the onset of test stimulus regardless of delay duration they magnitude correlate with task performance in summary stimulusspecific gba component with a predictive power for shortterm memory performance be observe in anticipation of test stimulus they may reflect the preparatory activation of memory representation or the shift of attention to the specific expect location of the test stimulus	Neuroimage.
