19936254	roy martinez platero lane werner-washburne	exploiting amino acid composition for predicting proteinprotein interactions	computational prediction of protein interaction typically use protein domain as classifier feature because they capture conserve information of interaction surface however approach rely on domain as feature can not be apply to protein without any domain information in this paper we explore the contribution of pure amino acid composition lrb aac rrb for protein interaction prediction this simple feature which be base on normalize count of single or pair of amino acid be applicable to protein from any sequence organism and can be use to compensate for the lack of domain information aac perform at par with protein interaction prediction base on domain on three yeast protein interaction dataset similar behavior be obtain use different classifier indicate that we result be a function of feature and not of classifier in addition to yeast dataset aac perform comparably on worm and fly dataset prediction of interaction for the entire yeast proteome identify a large number of novel interaction the majority of which colocalized or participate in the same process we high confidence interaction network include both wellstudied and uncharacterized protein protein with known function be involve in actin assembly and cell bud uncharacterized protein interact with protein involve in reproduction and cell budding thus provide putative biological role for the uncharacterized protein aac be a simple yet powerful feature for predict protein interaction and can be use alone or in conjunction with protein domain to predict new and validate exist interaction more importantly aac alone perform at par with exist but more complex feature indicate the presence of sequencelevel information that be predictive of interaction but which be not necessarily restricted to domain	PLoS_One.
21551143	roy werner-washburne lane	a multiple network learning approach to capture systemwide conditionspecific responses	conditionspecific network capture systemwide behavior under vary condition such as environmental stress cell type or tissue these network frequently comprise part that be unique to each condition and part that be share among related condition exist approach for learn conditionspecific network typically identify either only difference or only similarity across condition most of these approach first learn network per condition independently and then identify similarity and difference in a postlearning step such approach do not exploit the share information across condition during network learning we describe a approach for learn conditionspecific network that identify the shared and unique subgraph during network learn simultaneously rather than as a postprocessing step we approach learn network across condition set share datum from different condition and produce highquality network that capture biologically meaningful information on simulated datum we approach outperform a existing approach that learn network independently for each condition especially for small training dataset on microarray datum of hundred of deletion mutant in two yeast stationaryphase cell population the infer network structure identify several common and populationspecific effect of these deletion mutant and several highconfidence case of doubledeletion pair which can be experimentally test we result be consistent with and extend the exist knowledge base of differentiate cell population in yeast stationary phase c code can be access from httpwwwbroadinstituteorgsroycondspec	Bioinformatics.
